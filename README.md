# Super-Simple-Cdn

I was bored in class one day so I decided to make this, Its not the best nor the fastest but its super super simple. There could be methods to upload without knowing the Auth password but as long as the password is strong it should be fine

## Setup

Fill out example-config.json then rename it to config.json the run these commands

```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/Darker-Ink/super-simple-cdn

cd super-simple-cdn

npm i

node .
```
